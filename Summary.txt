Thanks for this opportunity.

This challenge for me was a big challenge, in five days I learned a new framework (NEXT.js, Tailwind). 
It was the first time I saw some challenges in the front-end, normally I don't feel this. 
Maybe you helped me to love the Front-end again. I know is missing some detail but I don't have time to be more perfectionist. 
I hope to be one of the selected for the next step and show I can learn quickly and be a good teammate.

If I am not, good luck with this project and see you soon.
